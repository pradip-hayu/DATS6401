                Data visualization in this project gives an insight about various airlines and helps people who are concerned about the airlines industry. Areas for improvement are pointed out and investors would be able to see which airline is used the most. Some of the highlights are as follows:

            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li>
                About 77 percentages of the flights arrive on time. Out of the five causes for airlines delay, the highest number of delays were due to National Aviation System (NAS refers to a broad set of conditions, such as non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control).
            </li>
            <li>
                Out of the five causes of delays, Weather and Security were comparatively low in number. The required authorities need to pay attention to reduce the other three causes of delay: NAS, Late Aircraft and Carrier.
            </li>
            <li>Airlines delays were highest in the months of June, July and December. Airlines delays were lowest in the months of September and November.</li>
            <li>Airlines delays were highest in the year 2007 and lowest in the year 2012.</li>
            <li>Airlines delays have an irregular pattern of increase and decrease over the years. Overall, delay rate is kind of decreasing. </li>
            <li>
                In terms of safety measures, Delta had the highest number of incidents. American airlines had the highest number of fatal incidents. Malaysia airlines had the highest number of fatalities. </li>
            <li>
                Out of all the domestic airlines compared, Delta Airlines had the highest revenue. It can be concluded that the airline with the highest revenue (Delta) had the highest number of incidents. </li>
            <li>United Airlines was the most popular airline (both domestic and international) in terms of total passengers count. </li>

            </ul>
