# Airlines-Delays-Safety-and-Their-Popularity
Author: Pradip Hayu

Objectives:

(1) Visualize the prime causes of flight delays

(2) Determine the safest airlines based on incidents, fatal accidents, and fatalities, and then measure the safety level of the airlines

(3) Figure out the airlines with the highest revenue, and

(4) Find out the airlines (domestic & international) which are most popular among passengers.

Data Source:

(1)The airlines delay data for this project was obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. This dataset is all about flights in the United States, including information about the number, length, and type of delays. The data is reported for individual months at every major airport for every carrier.https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/airlines/airlines.html

(2)The airlines safety data consists of airlines incidents, fatal accidents, and fatalities which came from Data World. https://data.world/fivethirtyeight/airline-safety

(3)The monthly passenger traffic statistics by the airline was retrieved from Data SF. https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Air-Traffic-Passenger-Statistics/rkru-6vcg

(4)The revenue of major US domestics airlines was obtained from the MIT Airline Data Project.http://web.mit.edu/airlinedata/www/Revenue&Related.html

This project uses the cleaned datasets (Final Cleaned Datasets) and illustrates the above objectives in the form of effective visualizations. The raw datasets (Original Datasets W/Python) has also been included. This folder also contains a Python notebook which was used to extract and clean those datasets. End users will be able to interface with a web-page where they will be able to navigate using various links to find data by topic and view and interact with the visualizations. If you are interested in the details, please open the "Webpage" folder. After that, please open the index.html using a web server, then you are able to view the web pages. There are 6 main pages: home, delays, passenger, safety, airline revenue, and conclusions. The interactions include the ability to hover over the graph to view detailed information. It is expected that the end users will be able to draw appropriate conclusions about various causes of flight delays, safety, revenue, and passengers after examining those visualizations.
